*Be sure to take measurements with logging disabled to ensure your logging logic is not impacting current/time measurements.*

*Please include screenshots of the profiler window detailing each current measurement captured.  See the file Instructions to add screenshots in assignment.docx in the ECEN 5823 Student Public Folder.*

4. Provide screen shot showing the connection interval settings. Do they match the values you set in your slave(server) code or the master's(client) values?. </br>
   Answer: The connection parameters match the values configured in the server code.  </br>

6. If possible, provide screen shot verifying the slave latency matches what was reported when you logged the values from event = gecko_evt_le_connection_parameters_id. </br>
   Answer: The observed slave latency does not match the expected slave latency. Specifically, the observed slave latency is 7 but the expected slave latency is 4. </br>
